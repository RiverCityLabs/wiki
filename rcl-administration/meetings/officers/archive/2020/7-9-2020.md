### Band Saw

Our existing 6 or 7 year old Harbor Freight Model 93762 band saw is broken. The gears in the gearbox were worn out due to the lubricant leaking out. Repair costs would be about $100 if we can find parts and assuming other parts are not worn out due to normal use. We believe repair cost would be better spent on a new replacement saw.

The table below list various replacement models we have researched and their approximate final cost, including applicable taxes and shipping cost. Most of these saws are based on the same model made by whatever Chinese manufacturer produces them. The Harbor Freight models include Alan's 20% Harbor Freight employee discount. The Harbor Freight 93762 is the exact replacement for our existing saw. We propose getting the Harbor Freight 63469 as it has a larger cutting capacity, hydraulically controlled cutting feed and a auto blade lubrication system.
