# Electronics

## Electronics made easy

* Voltage \(V\), Resistance \(R\) and Current \(I\). V measured in Volts, R measured in Ohms, I measured in Amps. \(1amp=1000 milliamp or ma\)

1. Voltage = IR , V/R=I
2. Example, to compute R for an LED. Vsource-Vled/I = R needed. 5V-1.7V/.010 A \(10ma\) =330 ohms \(Vled is forward voltage of LED from data sheet\)
