* Owner of the flea market at Expo Gardens wants to give us free banner space
  * Second Sunday of June (Jeep's contact)
    * Jeep will get the dimensions for the banner so we don't make one too big on accident.
    * Aaron will create the banner design once dimensions are determined. They'll put the design in slack when the rough draft is finished and before the banner is ordered.
