## BFL Alignment

* Joe has not had time to check alignment yet, will try to align it on Friday

## Midwest Maker Fest / Ignite Peoria

* Pinewood Derby
  * Cars are cut and getting finished by Men's Club
  * Jeep has been painting and printing cars to have extras
  * Awards are being finished by Al
  * Heather has been advertising to libraries, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, etc.
  * Track is 8'x 50', so 20'x50' would be nice to have
* Plan to have pizza for lunch for members who volunteer

## New Members

* Heather has been emailing people who came for tours but didn't sign up
* Two of the last 3 new members are people that Heather followed up with
* Visiting student is a member of a Makerspace at his school in Michigan, and Heather wants to know about giving him a starving membership for the remainder of his time in Peoria - officers agree

## Fiber Laser

* Joe recommends 30W JPM MOPA LPE (\~$4000) [https://lasersonly.com/products/flmzjpt30lp](https://lasersonly.com/products/flmzjpt30lp)
* Need a green acrylic box (\~$500)
* Concern - we need to maintain our CO2 laser capabilities first before adding a fiber laser, and replacing the Glowforge & BFL would cost $15K
* There are a number of new desktop lasers that are going to become commercially available soon. $30k laser for $5k. Recommendation to wait until these are available to replace Glowforge (if possible).

## CR-10 S5 Donation

* Printer is free, Will Staples has expressed interest in fixing it up
* Wes to let Quinton know that we will take it

## New Overhead Projector

* Our current projector is old and getting dim and hard to see
* Discussion to continue on Slack

## Membership Status

* 85 members - 72 full members, 5 starving, 8 digital
