## Budget

* 10 officers, Quorum is 50% or 5 officers
* Yea: Alan, Fred, Jeep, Heather, Wes
* Nay: none
* Budget proposal passes

## Glowforge Laser Tube

* Jeep talked to Jason Radford about the Glowforge
* He has not yet responded about question about his preference about how we should service Glowforge laser tube (that is expected to need replacement soon)

## Proposal to eliminate Meetup subscription

* Heather has been testing it, and impact seems minimal
* Eliminating it would save us $7 per month
