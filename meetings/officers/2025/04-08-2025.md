**Old Business:**\
Kate Kerr has not sent a formal resignation letter. Office abandoned and being filled by Kevin Ethridge.\
Officers voted in.\


Mary's grant got approved. Cost for ink will coming in shortly, storing in Josh's area for temp-control\


For changing Quorum:\
Calculation based upon members who attend member meeting or officers meeting. Eff date 12/1/2025,\
assuming passed. Recalculated yearly on 10/1 (date officer ballots are sent out). Voting by proxy still\
counted as vote. Votes count as being in a meeting. Voting makes you a contributing member of that\
meeting.\
Additional provision: discrepancy reviewed by officers by vote\
This does not take away anyone's right to vote. Everyone is encouraged and counts. We just need this\
for significant events and expenditures.\
65 members, 40% is 26. we have to have 33 votes. Took a month to get 32\


Bill attended PeoriaCon. A whole lot of stuff was sold we could make in a heartbeat, kids drop a lot of\
$ to get in. It is the right audience. Just as a thought to attract younger members.\
Disagreement due to price and engagement – huge problem with commitment to events.\
Please don't do call-outs on Slack, send direct messages instead. It turns people off Slack. No\
one/Everyone accountable, comes back to commitment. Officers – pleas monitor Slack and stay\
engaged.\


Motion approved for the financial report.\


Everything from last meeting has been received, purchase-wise. Intro to Arcdroid done Thursday, old\
one posted for sale on FB for $650, will take $600. Current offer for $500, internal member. Figure\
reached by comparing shipping/restocking fee.\
Thank you Mike for posting an agenda call.\


**New business:**\


Color InkJet printer: member brouigth one in and we fixed it up so it could expand the capabilities of a\
Cricut. Cricut has Print & Cut and we have that already. $220 dollars. If additional is needed, can\
approved later\
Debate on InkJet/laserjet/other printer/DTF ensues.\
Benefits: 3d stickers and vinyl\
It passes, purchase authorized.\


Registration for Ignite: Heather and Kevin to work on Thurs. Got business card for person for direct\
contact for Ignite. Meeting is next Thurs at noon, Charlie attending. Jeep may log in for virtual\
attendance.\
Build requirements for Ignite?\

Heather working on 2 color coin from 3yrs ago – redeveloping.\
More fidgets needed\
Jenga set to be discussed at next meeting.\
We are a Makerspace. It is everyone's responsibility to read and understand the eyewear issue. There\
are several pairs of UV eyeglasses in the plasma cutter area. If you personally need you need more\
protection, feel free to use. We are at +2 the requirements. They are for CNC and plasma, NOT for\
welding or hand-cut plasma welding. The req meeting are for CNC.

**Official proposal:**\
Proposed Bylaws Amendment: Quorum Calculation\
Purpose: To amend the current method of calculating quorum to better\
reflect active membership.\
Section \[Insert Relevant Section Number]: Quorum Calculation The\
quorum required to conduct official business at any meeting shall be\
calculated based on the number of active members. Active\
membership is defined as individuals who hold a full or family\
membership and have demonstrated engagement by attending at\
least one of the following within the previous 12 months:\
A members' meeting\
An officers' meeting\
Effective Date: This change shall take effect on December 1 2025.\
Quorum: will be Recalculated yearly Oct 1 to establish the new\
Quorum for officer election and other business that requires a Quorum\
for the following 12 months\
Proxy/Virtual vote will count as attending a meeting\
Additional Provisions: Any discrepancies or disputes regarding active\
membership status will be reviewed by officers.\
Note:Members who do not attend a listed event still have the right\
and are encouraged to vote. The vote will still be counted as normal\
but will not affect the base Quorum number.
