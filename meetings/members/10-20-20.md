# 10-20-20

Aaron read a statement expressing two main concerns he wanted  talk to the members about. The first concern was his observation that there was an increasing lack of empathy and patience among some members in their interaction with other members. His second concern was the shrinking number of people willing to help keep the space operational. See the following link for his complete statement.
