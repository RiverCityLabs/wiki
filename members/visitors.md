## Visitors Rules and Guidelines

Any non-member individual is allowed two non-public visiting days in every calendar year. Examples of non-public visiting days would be build nights, work days, and meet and greet events. In the event that an individual is found to be visiting more than two times in a calendar year, this individual will be reported to the board of directors and the decision of the board as to the actions that will be taken. All visitors must comply with by-law regulations and have a signed waiver upon entry.
