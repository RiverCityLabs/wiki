# Guest vs. Visitor

## Members

Members of River City Labs pay monthly dues to have access to the physical makerspace and community.

All Members are required to be 18 or older.

All Members must be trained in the safe and correct use of each machine before they are allowed to use it independently.

For detailed information about the requirements, privileges, and responsibilities of Membership please refer to our [Bylaws](https://wiki.rivercitylabs.space/operations/bylaws) and [Membership Terms](https://wiki.rivercitylabs.space/members/membership).

##  Guests

River City Labs encourages our Members to share the makerspace experience with their friends or family! Members are welcome to host Guests at any time that they themselves have access to the space.

*  **SAFETY FIRST!** All Guests must sign a [Liability Waiver](https://wiki.rivercitylabs.space/members/forms) upon entry to River City Labs. Guests may only assist with machine use under the strict direction of their certified Host Member. The Host Member is solely responsible for supervising their Guests.

##  Visitors

Visitors are welcome to check out the space during our Thursday community nights between 7 PM and 9 PM. These nights are primarily social, so they are a great opportunity to meet some of our amazing members and get a sense of the community. For a more detailed tour and information about becoming a Member please plan to attend one of our monthly Intro to RCL meetings. \(Schedule TBD\)

*  **SAFETY FIRST!** Visitors may **NOT** use any machines, tools, or equipment in the makerspace. Visitors may be restricted from entering certain areas of the space due to safety concerns. Visitors don't need to sign a Liability Waiver, but may do so if they would like their info added to our contact list.

##  Children

Anyone under the age of **18** will follow the expectations of either Guest or Visitor depending on whether they are accompanied by a Host Member.

*  **Curfew** Additionally, the membership has voted to enforce a 9:00 PM curfew for everyone under the age of **14** on any evening with a scheduled community event \(such as Tuesday and Thursday Build Nights\). This curfew may be waived for certain events that are specifically noted as "Family Friendly". The curfew does not apply to any evening with no scheduled events.
