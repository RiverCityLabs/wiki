# Onboarding

## Chat

We heavily use Slack for communication with membership and between other members.

We also have access to google hangout chat from our Gsuite, but it's not used at all

## Task Management

We use Trello for organizing officer tasks by focus area

## Documents and File storage

We use [Gsuite for non-profits](../administration/shared-drive.md) to handle our email, desktop publishing, and file storage needs

## Door Access

Once your new member 30 day probation period is up, we will invite you to the private door code channel that has the current door code on it.

## Machine Safety and Usage Training

Training is currently done on an ad-hoc basis. If you would like to receive training on a certain machine, please ask for training in one of the appropriate channels: \(\#woodworking, \#metalshop, \#3dprinting, \#lasers\) if you aren't sure, just ask in \#chat

## Asking for Help

If you aren't sure about something, please ask in the appropriate channel. If you aren't sure, just as in \#chat and someone can help you. Better to be safe than sorry.
