## Firearms Policy

### Definitions <a id="definitions"></a>

Firearm or, in common usage, a “gun”, “weapon” or equivalent term refers to a device that expels a projectile by means of energy released as the result of a chemical reaction.

Replicas are meant to look and mechanically act like a firearm. The inability to readily differentiate an item from a firearm shall define a replica.

Firearm Parts are any and all components that attach to a firearm, unless specifically exempted below. Parts from non-firearms that are interchangeable with a firearm are deemed to be firearm parts and are included in this definition.

Suppressors and/or Silencers: Any device or component intended to suppress or diminish the sound or the muzzle flash of a firearm.

Ammunition: Consumable supplies for a firearm, such as bullets, gunpowder or primers.

Reloading Activities: Any activity associated with the reloading or refurbishing of ammunition, including, but not limited to, casting bullets, processing cartridges, processing cases, gunpowder or primers.

Personal Carry: The carrying of a firearm, as permitted by Illinois law on or within a River City Labs' facility.
