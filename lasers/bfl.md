## **Operation**

1. Use a vector graphics program such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to create the object that you want to cut. You may also use the Lightburn software on the RCL laser computer to create the object.
2. Turn on the System switch on the BFL. The laser will home in the upper right corner and then return to the last saved origin point. The control display will say “Continue to work after Powercut ?” Press ESC to dismiss.
3. Sign in to the RCL laser computer. Check the \#laser-cutter slack channel description for the password.
4. Open the Lightburn application and import the file you created in step 1. You can also import picture objects. Lightburn supports the following file types: svg, ai, pdf, dxf, hpgl, lt, png, jpg, bmp.
5. Define layers and power, speed and type of cut for each layer using the Lightburn software. Make any adjustments needed to the file and save it as a .lbn file.
6. Set the Lightburn coordinate system to use “Current Position” and set the job origin to the lower right. **DO NOT** change the Device \(machine\) origin in Lightburn. This will always be the upper right for the BFL.
7. Click on the “Send” button to send your file to the BFL. Put in whatever name you want.
8. Go to the BFL. You will see the name and outline of the file you sent to the laser.
9. Place the material to be cut on the laser bed.
10. Use the arrow keys on the laser control to move the laser to the area on your material where you want to start the cut.
11. Press the Origin button.
12. Press the Box button. The laser will move to define the area of your cut.
13. If everything looks OK, close both of the lids. Turn on the Laser, Exhaust and Air switches.
14. Make sure the laser chiller is turned on.
15. Make sure the water valves to the laser are open.
16. Note the locations of the emergency stop button and fire extinguishers.
17. Press the Start button on the laser control to begin the cut.
18. STAY AT THE LASER until the cut is complete.
19. When the cut is complete, clear away any material from the laser bed. 
20. Turn the System, Laser, Exhaust and Air switches off. **DO NOT TURN OFF THE CHILLER.**
21. Clean the laser lens.
