# RCL Wiki

## Hosting

The wiki is a fully cloud hosted by [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). The monthly cost is waived for non-profit organizations and open-source projects, so it costs us nothing to host and there's no maintenance required to keep it operating.

## Backups

The entire wiki is currently synced with a [Github Repo](https://github.com/RiverCityLabs/wiki) under the River City Labs organization. Any changes made there will also be synced back to the site and vice versa.

## Updating the wiki

The preferred method of updating the wiki is through the gitbook web app. See the [contributing ](../guides/contributing.md)page for more info.
