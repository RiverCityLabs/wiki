## Install

In the unfortunate event we need to reinstall the reverse proxy server, here are the steps to replicate it:

1. Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32bit) to a Sandisk Endurance Pro SD card (longer sd card life)
2. log in via ssh
3. run `sudo raspi-config`
   1. change the default pi password
   2. expand the filesystem
4. run `sudo apt update && apt upgrade`
5.
