# How to Print

_**Disclaimer**: If you are ever unsure of anything during this process **PLEASE** reach out to someone. We would much rather take the 5 minutes to help with a honest question. Then spend potentially hours fixing a simple mistake._&#x20;

_Help can be found at_ [_#3d\_Printing_](https://rclpeoria.slack.com/archives/C046ZF2N9) _Slack Channel if no one is in the space._

## Slicer

We use [Lulzbot Cura](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura) for the Taz 6 and Robo3d Printers.&#x20;

We also use [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer\_424/) for the Prusa Mini+.&#x20;

There is a computer setup near the 3D printers that is preconfigured with all the software you need to print on our printers running Ubuntu.



## Print Server

Each 3D Printer at RCL has a raspberry pi running [Octoprint ](https://octoprint.org/)on it. The URL for accessing the Octoprint server is located on that printers' wiki page. The login info will be physically located near the printer itself.

## Preparing the Printer

You should always make sure the build plate (print bed) is clean. Even if you do not see any debris, you should always wipe down the build plate. Oils from fingers, dust, and other contaminants can get on the bed, and cause prints to not stick and fail.

Soap and Water is the simplest most effective way to remove any of those contaminants. You can simply put a little bit onto a paper towel and rub the build plate. This isn't a kitchen sink. Use light force to clean the surface and make sure it is dry once done. &#x20;
