# Contributing

Rough Draft:

1. Any downloadable files should be hosted in our google drive and linked here via a publicly shareable link
2. Try to limit page heirarchy to a depth of 3 at most. 
3. If you see a comment, try to implement the suggestion if it makes sense and you have the time, if you need explanation, ask in the \#wiki channel in slack
4. Try to format content as you write it. If you aren't sure, leave a comment asking for formatting help and someone can do it later.
5. Organize the information on the page from most important at the top less important moving downard, when possible



How to edit:

1. create a gitbook account via the invite link in the \#wiki slack channel invite \(do not post it here\).
   1. We recommend creating a unique account via email rather than signing in via gmail or github. 
      1. If you're complaining about another password to remember, you should really consider using a [password manager](https://www.lastpass.com) to handle your passwords for everything.
