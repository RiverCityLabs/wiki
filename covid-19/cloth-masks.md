# Cloth Masks

## Overview

We are standardizing our efforts on the [MakerMask ](https://www.project-cloth-masks.com/)from [Helpful Engineering](https://www.helpfulengineering.org/). This design has had input and validation from several healthcare professionals around the world. The design and assembly are incredibly straightforward and can be made using readily available materials \(reusable shopping bags\). The main material is NWPP \(non-woven polypropelene\), which is used in surgical grade masks already.

## Assembly

As they are actively developing that design and the website with their latest findings and build instructions, please refer to the [official site for instructions](https://www.project-cloth-masks.com/make-a-mask).

## Delivery

TBD. We are considering a couple drop off locations around the central illinois area and one of our members can collect them all in one trip. 

## Justifications

[The CDC acknowledges there are situations where these masks will be a viable option when all other options are exhausted/unavailable in a crisis/shortage](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html)

[Actual testing showing diy masks can offer some protection](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/diy-homemade-mask-protect-virus-coronavirus/)
