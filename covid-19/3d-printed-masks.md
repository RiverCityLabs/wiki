# The "MalaMask" Project \(N95 Alternative Filter\)

## About

_**A mask is only as good as the filter that it uses... Filter First, mask second!**_

#### _**IT PASSED!  We have found filters that have passed the 95% efficiency at the 0.3 micron spec!**_  [See the conclusion in the filter research document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

Welcome to the "MalaMask" project, a project focused on giving healthcare and first responder systems information to make an informed decision when choosing N95 alternative PPE. This project has been focused on researching filter media, testing combinations and providing factual data and results. We have been working with mask and filter industry experts to validate our research and findings, honing in on filter combinations that can meet the N95 filter spec. Once we had the filter figured out we have been designing a mask that can be either 3D printed and mass manufactured. In our design efforts we have worked with hospitals, safety officers and human faces to get you a mask that provides the proper seal to keep the outside air flowing only through the filter! Help us in spreading the word and getting PPE to the people who need it most and if you are a person or organization that needs N95 alternative options, you are in the right place!

We have wrapped up hospital "Almond Bitrex" N95 vapor fit testing and professional particulate testing on certified equipment designed to test at NIOSH standards.  As a result, we have filters that have passed the N95 fit testing and the lab tests &gt;= 95% efficiency at the 0.3 micron spec. [See our filter research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

This project is completely open source, we want to share this with the world to help protect the  healthcare workers and first responders that are taking care of the people with this horrible virus.

See "[The Playbook!](https://wiki.rivercitylabs.space/covid-19/3d-printed-masks#the-playbook)" section below for all research, documents, videos, and how-to's pertaining to this project.

**Please note this mask project is formally defined as a "Reusable Mask with one time use filters tested at N95 mask filter specs".**  Be aware, to be full NIOSH approved a full mask + filter must be tested together in coordination with the CDC to get the rating.  We are focused on getting masks to the people who need them ASAP and are putting resources toward the aspects that are needed short term for someone to make an informed safety decision.  Our main focus is filters that could be put in any mask that seals to the face and only allows air flow in and out through the filter.

Due to high demand of PPE at this time we will do our best to fulfill the orders that are placed. We will contact you regarding fulfillment and arrange delivery.

## The Filter

The filter is comprise of 5 layers of Merv 13 and 2 layers of cotton with a density of 0.6mm-0.85mm thick @ 1lb 9oz of pressure over a 3mm by 10mm area.

**Have you had this filter professionally tested?** YES! [See the results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

**How efficient is this filter when lab tested?** Average of 99.9697% efficient over 3 samples at the 0.3 micron spec @ 32 liters/minute. [See the results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

**What is the best efficiency you have found?** Average of 97.66% efficient over 5 samples at the 0.3 micron spec.  Average of 93.067% efficient over 3 samples at the 0.3 micron spec over 80 minutes.  Efficiency Range of 92.5% - 98.1% over all 8 samples. 5 of the 5 samples were at or above 95% for initial efficiency. Then why not this combination... well you have to balance breath-ability.  [See the results](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yupGFIhwD8AysjFTFQhwAgz6Ek0EjDfb) and [See our filter research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

**Where can I find the supplies needed to make this filter?** [See our Material Sourcing doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2JJbhaYfgdTknCVutDJhhNwSaVdwMeYBe52wzRGStc/edit?usp=sharing) or you can request filter media through our "[Request Product and Supplies](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHAC_TNfr9oT7GbtTdVPqMini52MBla2alOWfOZqBjBwrcTw/viewform?usp=sf_link)" form.  We also have a DIY section in the [manufacturing resources document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeWSGgiAR2baAT94O83xQv42Ih72nSFfywWchpVEivE/edit?usp=sharing) where you can make these yourself.

## How Can I help?

The Design is final for 3D Printing.  See our DIY section in the [manufacturing resources document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jeWSGgiAR2baAT94O83xQv42Ih72nSFfywWchpVEivE/edit?usp=sharing).  3D Printing masks aren't going to meet high demand in every situation so we are now moving to offset demand by looking at alternative manufacturing processes.  Things like vacuum forming, CNC fabric cutting, CNC machining, CNC laser cutting, and Silicone Casting.

If you have services to offer in any of these areas and would like to be a manufacturing supplier email joshua@rivercitylabs.space

## Part Donation Requirements

**Any Donated parts will be no cost to the healthcare systems receiving them!**  We do have to keep our doors open so we are charging for transportation and supplies that are manufactured or we are sourcing people for paid supplies.  River City Labs is a MakerSpace organization that is 100% volunteer run and operated.  We are trying to give back and also give people the ability to make a living in a Country where millions of people are out of work.

There are a few critical criteria we will be strictly monitoring for any 3D printed donated mask:

1. The print must adhere to the print settings mentioned below
2. The print must not have any stringing material
3. The print must not have ANY warping! This will cause a poor seal and ruin the effectiveness of the mask.

We will be inspecting every 3D printed mask that comes in for Quality Assurance to ensure we are providing only the best quality masks to our healthcare and first responder professionals. 

Ship All Parts to:  
River City Labs   
Attn: COVID RESPONSE  
7916 N Hale Ave  
Peoria, IL  61615

## Required Print Settings

It is critical that these settings are adhered to. The mask and filter design is undergoing extensive testing and validation under these settings only. If any of these variables are changed, we lose all confidence that we'll achieve the tested and proven performance.

#### Mask Parts

* Filament: PETG
* Nozzle temp: 255c
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm - 0.5mm
* Infill: 20%
* Layer height: 0.3mm or lower

#### Silicone Mold Parts

* Filament: PETG / PLA / ABS
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm - 0.5mm
* Infill: 30% \(mold will last longer\)
* Layer height: 0.3mm or lower

## Post processing

If your 3D print has some stringing, it is imperative to remove them. The approved way to remove the strings is **light sanding** with at least P220 - P500 grit sand paper.
