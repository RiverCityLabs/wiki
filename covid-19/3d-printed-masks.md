# The "MalaMask" Project \(N95 Alternative Filter\)

## Submit a Supplies Request

_\*\*\*\*_[_**Mask Request Form can be found Here.**_](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeHAC_TNfr9oT7GbtTdVPqMini52MBla2alOWfOZqBjBwrcTw/viewform?usp=sf_link)_\*\*\*\*_

There is no guarantee you will receive all supplies by making a request. We will do our best and are ramping up manufacturers to meet demand. We will contact you regarding fulfillment and arrange delivery.

## Overview

**Please note this mask project is formally defined as a "Reusable Mask with one time use filters, tested at N95 specs".**  Be aware, to be full NIOSH approved a full mask + filter must be tested together in coordination with the CDC to get the rating.  We are focused on getting masks to the people who need them ASAP and are putting resources toward the aspects that are needed short term for someone to make an informed safety decision.  Our main focus is filters that could be put in any mask that seals to the face and only allows air flow in and out through the filter.

The project does not just involve 3D printing masks but also using commonly found materials to create a respirator filter that is tested at the N95 requirements \(0.2 micron tolerance\) as a temporary solution until supply can meet with demand.

We are not coming to you blindly with this project. We are coming to you with research and initial testing complete with filter material combinations that have passed in a proper hospital vapor N95 fit test that is used on traditional N95 masks using "Almond bitrex". We have also been interviewing experts in the N95 mask industry and gathering their information for you to use. [See our filter research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvpCbRg_Sh6PIX0ziEDmQvnjWnJY5d0YOeTuWkOZNnA/edit?usp=sharing).

Currently we are having particulate testing done on testing equipment designed to test at NIOSH standards.  These test are being performed on the filter combinations we have found and are waiting on test results. 

This project is completely open source \(CC BY-SA\), we want to share this with the world before more healthcare workers / first responders become the next victims of this virus.

See "The Playbook!" section below for all research, documents, videos, and how-to's pertaining to this project.

## How Can I help?

The Design is final for 3D Printing.  3D Printing masks isn't going to meet high demand in every situation so we are now moving to offset demand by looking at alternative manufacturing processes.  Things like vacuum forming, CNC fabric cutting, CNC machining, and CNC laser cutting. 

If you have services to offer in any of these areas and would like to contribute fill out our manufacturing sign up form. Coming soon!

## Part Donation Requirements

**Any Donated parts will be no cost to the healthcare systems receiving them!**  We do have to keep our doors open so we are charging for transportation and supplies that are manufactured or we are sourcing people for paid supplies.  River City Labs is a MakerSpace organization that is 100% volunteer run and operated.  We are trying to give back and also give people the ability to make a living in a Country where millions of people are out of work.

There are a few critical criteria we will be strictly monitoring for any 3D printed donated mask:

1. The print must adhere to the print settings mentioned below
2. The print must not have any stringing material
3. The print must not have ANY warping! This will cause a poor seal and ruin the effectiveness of the mask.

We will be inspecting every 3D printed mask that comes in for Quality Assurance to ensure we are providing only the best quality masks to our healthcare and first responder professionals.

## Required Print Settings

It is critical that these settings are adhered to. The mask and filter design is undergoing extensive testing and validation under these settings only. If any of these variables are changed, we lose all confidence that we'll achieve the tested and proven performance.

#### Mask Parts

* Filament: PETG
* Nozzle temp: 255c
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm - 0.5mm
* Infill: 20%
* Layer height: 0.3mm or lower

#### Silicone Mold Parts

* Filament: PETG / PLA / ABS
* Nozzle diameter: 0.4mm - 0.5mm
* Infill: 30% \(mold will last longer\)
* Layer height: 0.3mm or lower

## Post processing

If your 3D print has some stringing, it is imperative to remove them. The approved way to remove the strings is **light sanding** with at least P500 grit sand paper.
