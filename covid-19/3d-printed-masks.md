# 3D Printed Masks

## Overview

This mask design was created by Josh Malavolti of River City Labs. He has put a lot of research into his design and is actively getting it properly tested along with his diy filter media design.

## How Can I help?

As we finalize details, we'll update this section on what you can do as an individual with a compatible printer \(see settings below\).

For now, the most important thing you can do is make sure your printer works. We know how these things go, and our printers spend most of their time in disrepair due to our irrational need to constantly improve and tweak them.

Get your printer working, and keep it in working condition!

## Donation Requirements

There are a few critical criteria we will be strictly monitoring for any donated mask:

1. The print must adhere to the print settings mentioned below
2. The print must not have any stringing material
3. The print must not have ANY warping! This will cause a poor seal and ruin the effectiveness of the mask.

We will be inspecting every printed mask that comes in for Quality Assurance to ensure we are providing only the best quality masks to our healthcare professionals. 

## Required Print Settings

It is critical that these settings are adhered to. The mask and filter design is undergoing extensive testing and validation under these settings only. If any of these variables are changed, we lose all confidence that we'll acheive the tested and proven performance.

* filament: PETG
* nozzle temp: 255c
* nozzle diameter: 0.4mm - 0.5mm
* infill: 20%
* layer height: 0.3mm or lower

## Post processing

If your print has some stringing, it is imperative to remove them. The approved way to remove the strings is **light sanding** with at least P500 grit sand paper.
