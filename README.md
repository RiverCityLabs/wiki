# River City Labs

## What is a Wiki and Why do we need one?

That question is best answered in long form [here](https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/what-are-wikis-and-why-should-you-use-them--cms-19540).  
  
TL;DR version: collaborative editing by the users of a site containing a shared commonwealth of knowledge.
